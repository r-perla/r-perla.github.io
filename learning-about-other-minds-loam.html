        <h2>Learning About Other Minds (LOAM)</h2>
        <h3>Participant information for the online study</h3>
        <p>Dear participant,</p>
        <p>With this letter, we invite you to participate in the above-mentioned study. Please read the following
            information carefully. You can then decide whether you wish to participate or not. Allow yourself sufficient
            time and ask the study staff any questions that are important to you. The study is financed by public funds
            (from the German Research Foundation).</p>

        <h3>Purpose of the study</h3>
        <p>Our behavior is marked by a certain characteristic tendency in how we strategically behave in social
            situations. We have good reason to suspect that patterns of behavior in repetitive social interactions over
            time may shed light on important aspects of psychological well-being. For this reason, we want to use
            mathematical models and imaging techniques to investigate the occurrence of strategic reasoning in the
            brain.</p>

        <h3>Personal benefit of the study</h3>
        <p>The results of this study could help us to learn more about cognitive function and mental health. You will
            not benefit personally from participating in the study.</p>

        <h3>Duration and procedure of the study</h3>
        <p>This online study takes about 40-60 minutes. As part of the sub-experiments, you will be asked to complete
            questionnaires, absorb logic tests and play a two-player game against a (pre-programmed) computer player.
            Each section of the experiment will start automatically with all necessary explanations after pressing the
            study link.</p>

        <h3>Unintended effects/risks</h3>
        <p>The computer-based tasks and games may trigger positive and negative feelings in you. If you would like to
            talk about your feelings during an on-site examination, a member of staff from the Clinic for General
            Psychiatry will be available to you throughout the examination. For the online surveys, you can contact us
            by phone or email Korn (phone: 06221 56-4363, email: <a href="mailto:christoph.korn@med.uni-heidelberg.de">christoph.korn@med.uni-heidelberg.de</a>). The survey can
            be terminated at any time at your request without giving reasons.</p>

        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>The provisions of data protection law are compiled with. During the online survey, your decisions and
            individual demographic information will be collected and stored electronically. This data will be stored in
            pseudonymized form, evaluated and published on the Internet. Pseudonymization is the processing of personal
            data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without
            adding additional information (“key”). This additional information is stored separately by Prolific.co and
            is subject to technical and organizational measures which ensure that the personal data cannot be assigned
            to an identified or identifiable natural person. Prolific.co has access to the pseudonymization code but has
            no access to the data. We only receive the pseudonymized data that you give us.</p>
        <p>This data may be passed on to universities/clinics/companies in pseudonymized form, possibly also to
            countries where data protection requirements are lower than in the European Union. However, third parties
            will not be given access to original documents. The study management will take all reasonable steps to
            ensure the protection of your data in accordance with the data protection standards of the European Union.
            The data is secured against unauthorized access. Decryption of the data is not possible from our side. If
            you withdraw from the study, we can delete your data if you wish so. As soon as it is possible according to
            the research or statistical purpose, the personal data will be anonymized. Anonymization is the alteration
            of personal data in such a way that individual details about personal and factual circumstances can no
            longer be attributed to a specific or identifiable natural person, or can only be attributed to a specific
            or identifiable natural person with a disproportionate amount of time, cost or labor. It is not possible to
            draw any conclusions about individuals. The data is published in anonymized form when the results are
            published, so that other researchers can use this data to check the results and to analyze further
            questions. Since this data is anonymized, no one, including yourself, can draw inferences from the data to
            your person.</p>
        <p>You have the right to request information from the responsible person (see below) about the personal data
            stored about you. You can also request the correction of inaccurate data and the deletion of data or the
            restriction of its processing. The person responsible for the study-related collection of personal data is:
